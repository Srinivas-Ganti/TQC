# 0. Draw state machine.
1. re-run classification script - find new Air/ Sensor parameters - change sensor tomorrow
2. examine 10 avgs/ None bug. Check Classification trigger
3. Add delay for cartridge travel w/ lin actuator
4. refactor StdRef in qc routine. Button state control. Dont use "live sensing". Instead use full robot control.
5. Use triggered Sensor check using 'Ack' from robot instead
6. Modify robot code to send 'Ack' on task completion. 
7. Implement keepout zone for operator mode whilst jogging motors
8. refactor qc routine for mechanical unit test e.g. 200 QC operations.


0. STATE MACHINE:
-------------------
          
          ALIGN 1 and ALIGN 2 correspond to the two table positions needed to operate the QC loop.

0 - RELAY OFF - motors off
1 - RELAY ON - coils energised homing unknown, jogging enabled 

State 1 - operator mode 

1.1 - RIG HOMED (MOT1 and MOT2)
1.2 - ALIGN 1 (cartridges withdrawn)
1.3 - ALIGN 1 (cartridges extended)
1.4 - ALIGN 2 (cartridges withdrawn)
1.5 - ALIGN 2 (cartridges extended)

State 2 - QC loop active

2.1 - ALIGN 1 (cartridges withdrawn)
2.2 - ALIGN 1 (cartridges extended)
2.3 - ALIGN 2 (cartridges withdrawn)
2.4 - ALIGN 2 (cartridges extended)

State 3 - Errors 

3.1 - no ACK
3.2 - ALIGN 1/2 (cartridges extended) - Air instead of sensor -> retry - timeout
3.3 - crash (implement with sw interrupt?)
